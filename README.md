## What is Listz

[Listz](https://www.github.com/listz) is a collection of repositories that represent a certain type of technology or subject. Each repository contains a list where GitHub users can add items by cloning and creating pull requests. Each list can be queried using the Listz app, which is still under development as of now.

## How does a serialized Listz object look like?

You can take a look at the (listz.json)[listz.json] file, which is a simple json string representing a `Listz` object containing one item.
